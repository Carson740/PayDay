# PayDay
#Welcome to Payday!
#Payday is a tool that makes it easy to see how much money you'll have left over after expenses.


#Use the config.txt file to input values that you don't want to type into the window each time.

#Press the "Calculate" button once all fields have been filled out to get your result.


#If you wish to change your input:
	
# Change any values either in the input window, or in the config file.
	
# Press "Calculate" to receive your new results.
	
# If you had values in the config, and you wish to edit directly in the window, remove values from config, then reopen Payday.
	
# If you did not have values in the config, and wish to input them there, do so and then reopen PayDay, or input a 0 in desired field(s)
