# PayDay
Welcome to Payday!
Payday is a tool that makes it easy to see how much money you'll have left over after expenses.


Use the config.txt file to input values that you don't want to type into the window each time.

Press the "Calculate" button once all fields have been filled out to get your result.


If you wish to change your input:

	Press the "Remove Output" button to get rid of your previous results.
	
	Change any values either in the input window, or in the config file.
	
	Press "Calculate" to receive your new results.
	
	If you had values in the text file, and you wish to edit directly in the window, please reopen Payday.
	
	If you did not have values in the text file, and wish to input them there, please do so and then reopen PayDay.
